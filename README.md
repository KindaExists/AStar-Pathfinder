# AStar-Pathfinder

This was my earlier attempt to make an 8-Directional A* Pathfinding algorithm in Python 3.x

Not much in the way of special coding techniques were used to make this program, overall, the program is just a basic implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.


Note: Only the "A_Star_Simple.py" and "A_Star_Visual.py" files work, the "A_Star.py" file was not completed
